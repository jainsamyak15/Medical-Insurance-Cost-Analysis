# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Analysis

+ Performed comprehensive data wrangling and cleaning on a medical insurance dataset, handling missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering
+ Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns influencing insurance charges using statistical methods and visualizations like scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps
+ Engineered relevant features from categorical variables (e.g., smoker status) and derived new features based on EDA insights
+ Developed multiple linear regression models to predict insurance charges based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, and region
+ Experimented with advanced regression techniques like polynomial regression and regularization (ridge, lasso) to improve prediction accuracy
+ Performed systematic hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to optimize model performance
+ Achieved high prediction accuracy with an R-squared of 0.84 on the test set using a ridge regression model with polynomial features
+ Implemented data pipelines using Scikit-learn for efficient modeling workflow
+ Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning
